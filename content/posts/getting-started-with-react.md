# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this tutorial, we'll explore the fundamentals of React and how to get started with component-based development.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Key Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of any React application. They are reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

### Props

Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components.

### State

State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

## Getting Started

To get started with React, you'll need Node.js installed on your machine. Then you can create a new React app using:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will create a new React application and start the development server.

## Conclusion

React provides a powerful way to build modern web applications. With its component-based architecture and rich ecosystem, you can create anything from simple websites to complex applications.
